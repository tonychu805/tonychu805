## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### 1. NBA Players Analysis - Dissertation for University of Bath Master's of Business Analytics
**Code:** 
1. [`Question 1 - three point evolution.ipynb`](https://github.com/tonychu805/NBA_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Question%201%20-%20three%20point%20evolution.ipynb)
2. [`Question 2 - players categorizations.ipynb`](https://github.com/tonychu805/NBA_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Question%202%20-%20players%20categorizations.ipynb)
3. [`Question 3 - MVP predictions.ipynb`](https://github.com/tonychu805/NBA_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Question%203%20-%20MVP%20predictions.ipynb)    

**Presentation:** [`Research Paper`](https://github.com/tonychu805/NBA_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Dissertation%20-%20Final%20dissertation.pdf)

**Description:** The three datasets curated and used from Kaggle contain players and games statistics from 1950 to the present, MVP candidates and winners over the years, as well as all shot locations of all games. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing, and implementing a variety of machine learning algorithms mentioned below.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization, segmentation analysis, linear regression analysis, support vector machine, random forest, decision trees, principle components analysis,

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn

**Results:** A deep dive into the impact of three-point shots on the NBA game, user type based on analytics, and prediction of NBA MVPs.  


### 2. Food Delivery Platform Analysis - Go-To-Market Strategies
**Code:** [`Otter - Case Study Analytics - Tony Chu V2.ipynb`](https://github.com/tonychu805/Food_Delivery_Platforms_Analysis/blob/main/Otter%20-%20Case%20Study%20Analytics%20-%20Tony%20Chu%20V2.ipynb)    

**Presentation:** [`Otter - Case Study Analytics`](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fcv7K0vxSrBWxyRH99rtU1w3BD2VbsgeYe6uky-mt-I/edit?usp=sharing)

**Visualizations:** [`Tableau Dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tony.chu3466/viz/OtterrestaurantanalysisV2/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

**Description:** Using a food delivery platform dataset in the US containing delivery partners such as Ubereats, Postmates, FoodPanda, and others, I used R language to conduct data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis, while using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard to showcase actionable insights that the delivery analytics product team may take to maximize sales

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization

**Technology:** R, tidyr, dplyr, ggmap, psych, maps, ggplot2, tidygeocoder

**Results:** A thorough analysis of the business operations and performances of each platform among SMBs and enterprise customers, and the recommended go-to actions.  

### 3. Bath Airport Passenger Arrival Simulation and Optimization
**Code:** [`Graded_Assignment_Develop_and_Run_Simulation_final.ipynb`](https://github.com/tonychu805/bath_airport_simulation/blob/main/Graded_Assignment_Develop_and_Run_Simulation_final.ipynb)    

**Presentation:** [`Otter - Case Study Analytics`](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pn1hxxq-ltGTDHM2UDzShdar2B9wJSWtUuLzLInyePw/edit?usp=sharing)

**Description:** To answer how many passport control gates are needed to make sure that the waiting time in the passport control stage is less than a minute 98% of the time, should the airport combine the check-in desks of different airlines, and is the current allocation of check-in desks and passport control gates ideal?

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, simulation modeling

**Technology:** Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy

**Results:** Constructive and actionable insights of how Bath airport can optimize passenger check-in workflow using the detailed outcome of check-in desks’ average wait time, passport gates’ average wait time, total average wait time, and ratio of total passengers who have less than 1 minute of waiting time at the passport gate. 

### 4. Smartphone user clustering
**Code:** [`Data Mining - Graded Assignment.ipynb`](https://github.com/tonychu805/smartphone_user_clustering/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20-%20Graded%20Assignment.ipynb)    

**Presentation:** [`Smartphone user clustering`](https://github.com/tonychu805/smartphone_user_clustering/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20-%20Graded%20Assignment.docx)

**Description:** A handful of exploratory analyses such as identifying missing values and outliers, and exploring correlations of each variable, as well as clustering analyses including partitional clustering, hierarchical clustering, and soft (fuzzy) clustering techniques, are performed among different parameters using R language, to classify, label, or group data points contained within the data set.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, simulation modeling

**Technology:** R, dplyr, magrittr, ggplot2, tidyverse, finalfit, hmisc, pastecs, psych, corrplot, discriminer, base, reshape2, resample, dendextend, fpc, dbscan

**Results:** Three naturally occurring clusters are ultimately identified. However, further analyses of each identified cluster will need to be conducted if the management would like to learn more about each of its characteristics.

### 5. Credit fraud detection
**Code:** [`fraud_detection.ipynb`](https://github.com/tonychu805/credit_card_fraud_detection/blob/main/fraud_detection.ipynb)

**Description:** With a given credit card transaction dataset that has been processed with principal component analysis, the exercise seeks to identify a model that can accurately predict future credict card fraud using machine learning algorithm.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, description analysis, correlation analysis, machine learning

**Technology:** Python, sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest

**Results:** Logistic Regression has the highest predictive power to detect credit card fraud with 95.42% accuracy.

## Small Projects
In this section, I will list smaller scale data analytics projects and exercises.

### 1.	Building a retail data pipeline
