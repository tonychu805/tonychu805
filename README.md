## IV. Cybersecurity and Fraud Prevention Projects

### 1. Credit fraud detection
**Repository:** [`https://github.com/tonychu805/credit_card_fraud_detection`](https://github.com/tonychu805/credit_card_fraud_detection)

**Description:** With a given credit card transaction dataset that has been processed with principal component analysis, the exercise seeks to identify a model that can accurately predict future credict card fraud using machine learning algorithm.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, description analysis, correlation analysis, machine learning

**Technology:** Python, sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest

**Results:** Logistic Regression has the highest predictive power to detect credit card fraud with 95.42% accuracy.

### 2. Cybersecurity Threat Analysis
**Repository:** [`https://github.com/tonychu805/cybersecurity-threat-analysis`](https://github.com/tonychu805/cybersecurity-threat-analysis)

**Description:** In this project, I delved into the patterns and characteristics of vulnerabilities, their severity, the speed of patching, and temporal trends.

**Technology:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, scikit-learn, glob, os

**Results:** 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72696e87-064e-44ff-93e0-a45adbba4ff0)
- Windows is identified as the most affected product with 311 reported vulnerabilities.
- Network-Related vectors accounted for 73.4% of vulnerabilities.
- 34% of the reported incidents were critical, posing severe risks.

### 3. Microsoft Security Incident Prediction
**Repository:** [`https://github.com/tonychu805/Microsoft_Security_Incident_Prediction`](https://github.com/tonychu805/Microsoft_Security_Incident_Prediction)

**Description:** The goal is to build a predictive model for predicting cybersecurity incident outcomes. The target value for this dataset is called "IncidentGrade", which contains values true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), and false positive (FP)â€”based on historical data.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data encoding, standardization, significant test (chi-square, anova, mutual information), machine learning, cross validation

**Technology:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost

**Results:** 

- LightGBM and XGBoost are the two standout models for predicting cybersecurity incident outcomes. LightGBM excels in precision (72.4%) and recall (69.4%), making it highly effective for reducing false positives and detecting true incidents, while XGBoost is the most consistent performer across different datasets.
- CatBoost is a strong alternative that balances high accuracy and low variability.
- RandomForest and GradientBoost could be considered for specific scenarios, but they are less suited for tasks requiring a balance between high precision and recall.

| Model         | Precision    | Recall       | F1-Score     | Support     | Accuracy    |
